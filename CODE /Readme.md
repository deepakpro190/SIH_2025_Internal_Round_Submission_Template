## Local Setup Instructions (Windows & macOS)

Follow these steps to run the Ayur.dev project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone GITHUB_LINK_TO_THE_REPO
cd REPO_DIRECTORY

# Admin Panel
cd admin
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd ../backend
npm install

# Backend Server
cd backend
npm run server

# Admin Panel
cd ../admin
npm run dev

# Frontend Panel
cd ../frontend
npm run dev


This is fully ready to paste into your README without modification (except replacing the GitHub link).  

If you want, I can also make an **even more compact version** that runs everything sequentially with fewer `cd` commands so beginners can just copy-paste into the terminal. Do you want me to do that?
